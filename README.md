# Web Task Management: Collaborative Project Management for Remote Teams
The project curently is coming to an end.

I created a web-based platform: a system that manages tasks in remote teams, facilitating effective collaboration on projects. Real-time task assignment, priority tracking and role-based access control were implemented. The platform allows the Owner to oversee every element in the team, designates leaders to manage projects. Project leaders oversee the team's progress. There is also constant communication thanks to shared emails. The process of deploying team members is based on invitations.
